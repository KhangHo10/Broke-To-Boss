    <h1><strong>Beginner - Building Credit Confidence </strong></h1>

    <div class="section-container">
      <p><strong>Understanding What a Credit Card &#128179 Is:</strong> A credit card is a financial tool that allows you to borrow money up to a certain limit to make purchases or pay for services. Instead of using cash or your own money, you borrow from the bank or credit card company and pay them back later. People use credit cards for convenience, to build their credit history, and for added protection on purchases. You can make purchases now and repay them over time, but it's essential to pay attention to interest rates and repayment terms.</p>
       <p><strong>Introduction to Interest Rates &#128200 (APR):</strong> The interest rate on a credit card is called the Annual Percentage Rate (APR). This is the cost of borrowing money on your credit card if you don’t pay off your balance in full each month. For example, if you only pay part of your balance, the remaining balance will be charged interest. The higher the APR, the more interest you’ll pay. It’s important to pay your balance on time to avoid late fees and additional interest.</p>
       <p><strong>How to Apply for Your First Credit Card:</strong> When applying for your first credit card, it's best to start with either a secured credit card or a starter card designed for beginners. <strong><p>To apply:</p></strong>
       <p>1. Research credit cards with low fees and rewards that match your needs.
        <p>2. Fill out an application form online or at a bank.</p>
        <p>3. Provide information like your income, address, and social security number.</p>
        <p>4.  Wait for approval, which is often based on your credit score and income. If you have no credit history, a secured credit card (which requires a deposit) can be a good option to help you build credit over time.</p>
