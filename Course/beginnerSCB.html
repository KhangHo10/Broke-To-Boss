        <strong>Savings</strong> refer to the practice of setting aside money for future use &#128193;, which is essential for achieving financial stability and supporting long-term goals. There are different types of savings accounts available. Basic savings accounts typically allow easy access to funds but offer lower interest rates, while high-yield savings accounts provide higher interest rates, often with certain restrictions on access to the funds.

        To start saving effectively, itâ€™s important to consistently allocate a small percentage of your income each month. This gradual approach helps build a savings habit and can lead to significant growth over time, ultimately contributing to your financial security and helping you meet your future financial objectives.

        <strong>Checking accounts</strong> are specifically designed for everyday transactions, providing greater flexibility than savings accounts, which primarily focus on accumulating funds. Key features of checking accounts include debit cards for easy access to funds, online banking for convenient account management, and the ability to write checks for payments or bills. To open a checking account, you generally need to provide identification, proof of address, and an initial deposit.

        A <strong>budget</strong> serves as a financial plan that helps you manage your income and expenses, ensuring that you maintain financial health and achieve your financial goals. A simple budgeting method is the <u>50/30/20</u> rule, which suggests allocating 50% of your income to needs, 30% to wants, and 20% to savings or debt repayment. To stay on track with your budget, it's important to monitor your spending, which can be done using a notebook, spreadsheet, or budgeting app. This helps you understand your financial habits and stay within your set budget.
